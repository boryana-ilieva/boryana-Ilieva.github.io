**Climbing the career ladder: Gender differences in promotions and part-time work**

In this paper I study the interaction between part-time work and promotions. Many gender gaps still persist until today - on average women earn less than men; they participate in the labor market less then men; women are underrepresented in high levels of the career ladder. In this work I develop a new dynamic life-cycle choice model which endogeneises career ladder advancements as a function of experience, which, in turn, accumulates at different rates depending on individual hours worked.


**Biased wage expectations and female labor supply** *with Maximilian Blesch, Philipp Eisenhauer, Peter Haan, Annekathrin Schrenker and Georg Weizsäcker*

We analyze how biased beliefs about future wages affect labor supply decisions in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we quantify the effects of biased expectations regarding wage growth and human capital accumulation in part-time and full-time employment on female labor market outcomes. Based on customized elicitation of expectation data, we find that both full-time employees and part-time employees have expectations about wage growth in part-time employment that are severely upward biased: employees do not realize that wage growth occurs almost exclusively in full time. Empirically, wage growth rates in part-time work are close to zero, as we show with reduced form estimations where we tackle selection biases using a control function approach. We leverage the structural life cycle model to quantify how biased beliefs drive labor supply choices and wage profiles over the life cycle.



**Selection effects and the distribution of the gender wage gap - a novel approach** *with Peter Haan and Christoph Breunig*

In this paper we propose a new empirical approach to analyze the distribution of the gender wage gap. A key challenge in wage analysis is that observed wages are strongly affected by selection into employment which is determined by unobserved preferences. We provide a new empirical identification strategy that deals with *endogenous selection* by directly modeling the selection probability over the wage distribution. Our approach relies on instrumental variables that explain variation in the latent variable but have no direct effect on selection conditional on the latent process. We illustrate this novel estimation approach empirically using the administrative data of the German Social Security records. We use wage information from the individual earnings history as an instrument. We find that female and male wages are positively selected but the effect is stronger for women. Correspondingly, the selection corrected gender wage gap is larger than the raw wage gap over the entire wage distribution. We find that selection effects persist even after we condition on observable characteristics. In terms of heterogeneity, we find that selection effects are particularly strong for individuals with low levels of education and experience.


**What to expect when COVID-19 lockdown ends? Individual expectations about the labor market and re-openings in the United States** *with Katharina Baum*
(submitted)

We study how individual subjective expectations about the labor market responded to re-openings after lockdowns. State governments issued strict lockdown orders to stop the spread of COVID-19 in spring 2020. Officials planned that subsequent re-openings would kick-start the economy, bring back jobs, and install optimism about a fast economic recovery. We argue that re-openings were largely unsuccessful in shifting labor market expectations in a positive direction. Analyzing survey data on expectations about earnings from employment and the probability of job loss, we estimate the causal effect of re-openings on these expectations. We find that in May 2020 individuals expected significantly lower earnings compared to their levels before the pandemic and incomplete recovery in six months’ time. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find causal evidence that long-run earnings expectations improved significantly as a result of the re-opening. In contrast, expectations about the immediate future and about job loss were unaffected. As previous studies analyzed if lockdowns had a dampening effect on economic activity, our results add the dimension of expectations as important predictors and drivers of economic outcomes.
